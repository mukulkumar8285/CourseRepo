# Axios Fetch README

This project demonstrates how to use Axios to fetch data from an API endpoint.

## Description

This script uses Axios, a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, to make a GET request to the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and fetches a todo item with ID 1. The fetched data is then logged to the console.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Install dependencies using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install axios
   # or
   yarn add axios
